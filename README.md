# 🚀 FastAPI-ML

Welcome to **FastAPI-ML** — a collection of my learning journey with **FastAPI**, including **mini backend projects** and **Machine Learning model deployments** using FastAPI.

This repository is perfect for anyone looking to learn how to build **modern, high-performance APIs** with **FastAPI** and integrate them with **ML models** for real-world use cases.

## 🧠 What is FastAPI?

**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with **Python 3.7+** based on **standard Python type hints**.  

It’s one of the fastest frameworks available, built on top of **Starlette** (for web parts) and **Pydantic** (for data validation).
